1. Encipher.c & Decipher.C 

by using Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, program takes in input text file, and a 'shift' value, and will shift the text and overwrite
it to the existing file. Decipher does the same but shifts the letters the opposite direction.

2. playgame.sh

There is a game where you have to guess what two thirds of the average of all guesses will be. It works like this: 10 people guess a random number between 1 to 50. This data is stored in a file as the initial data available to begin playing. Now a user runs the script and is prompted for input where he enters a number. If the number is within +/-10% of the 2/3rds of the average of input data in the file, the player wins. The user can guess up to 3 times before the script terminates and prints the number of guesses the user took to guess the right number and how the user compares to other players.
